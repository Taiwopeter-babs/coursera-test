		<div class="taiwo">Experiences define our memories, nonetheless there are some I wouldn’t wish happened to a bitter foe.
	I really try to be normal. You know the usual stuff like connecting with people, building relationships, be less isolated and engage in meaningful conversations or “meaningless” ones with a dark or sarcastic sense of humor, and as much as I try to fit in, I fail miserably

		<div class="taiwo">Sometimes it gets me mad and sometimes it pushes me to my darkness. I avoid intimacy because I am scared. Afraid that it might all end before it even begins, afraid I might blow it all up because of my insecurities, afraid I might be too vulnerable and afraid to see, hear, think and feel love.</div>

		<div id="head3">End</div>
		<div class="taiwo">I learnt very recently that we do not have that time to be afraid to do what we want and it came in a very hard way. As this comes with pain - I mourn, weep and remember friends who passed on. Families who have lost loved ones may not see this, but I feel their loss, eat their pain, and drink with the same cup of sorrows that made their tears flow endlessly. I pray for the will and strength to go on knowing the departed souls remain as shining lights in their hearts.
